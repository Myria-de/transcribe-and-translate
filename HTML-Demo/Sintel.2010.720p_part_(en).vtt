This blade has a dark past.

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
It has shed much innocent blood.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
You're a fool for traveling alone so completely unprepared.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
You're lucky your blood's still flowing.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Thank you.

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
So, what brings you to the land of the Gatekeepers?

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
I'm searching for someone.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Someone very dear.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
A kindred spirit.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
A dragon.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
A dangerous quest for a lone hunter.
